This is a flutter app developed in 24hrs during the annual 2021 hackathon at binghamton university.
It is a platform to buy and sell items safely within the Binghamton Community.

To run this, first install flutter, run pub get then run on desired emulator. Note it may not suppourt flutter 2.0

Main features include login/signin, validation through school email, posting items, making bids, and a main page to see all listed items. 
The backend was made using google's firebase and uses auth, storage, and the realtime db it offers.

Please note for safety reasons posting/retrieving items is no longer available starting April 4th 2021.
